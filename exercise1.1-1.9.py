#Exercise 1.1
# the function of a secondary memory in a computer is to store programs and data. It retains information even if the
#power is off. It is typically slower than main memory.

#Exercise 1.2
# A program is "a set of instructions that specifies a computation."

#Exercise 1.3
# An interpreter is used to read the source code of a program that is written by the programmer.
# It parses the source code, and interprets instructions quickly.
#A compiler needs the entire program in a file. The compiler can then run a process to translate the high level source
# code into machine language. The compiler can then put the resulting machine language into a file to be executed at a
# later time.

#Exercise 1.4
#The Python interpreter has machine code inside of it.

#Exercise 1.5
# The grammer in the code needs to checked due to the SyntaxError. Print should have been written instead of primt.

#Exercise 1.6
# Avariable such as "x" is stored after a Python line finishes in the Main Memory which stores data.

#Exercise 1.7
x = 43
x = x + 1
print (x)

#Results = 44

#Exercise 1.8
# The Central Processing unit would be like the human brain. The Main Memory would the part of the brain that stores
#memory. The Secondary Memory would be like github in that memory out lives the brain. The input device obtains data
#from the outside world, so this would be comparible to the eyes obtaining information. The output device is used to '
# is useful for displaying results of a program or storing them in a file which can be compared to fat storing energy.

#Exercise 1.9
# A syntax error is when the grammar rules of Python have been violated. If the grammar is corrected, the syntax error
#may be fixed.
